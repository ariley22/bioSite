    <p>Ever since my sister Nicole was little, connecting with people was very important to her. She shined most at family gatherings, where she had a knack for being a social butterfly and the center of attention. She was a happy kid, full of life and always up for an adventure. She drew people to her and it was very easy for her to make friends.</p>
<p>It’s really true that people’s personalities don’t change that much over time. As an adult, she’s always organizing events to bring people together and show them how to have fun. She loves to pursue active and creative hobbies, just like the active games and arts and crafts she loved as a kid. Depending on the day, you might find her hiking in the local mountains, kayaking in the local river, or painting pictures with her husband, who is also very artistic.</p>
