        <p class="right-text">In terms of what she does for work, a better question would be what she hasn’t done. She started out teaching preschool, then moved onto photography. She then trained in quick succession as a yoga instructor, interior designer, and a copywriter, the latter of which she currently does professionally.</p>

        <p class="left-text">Nicole met her now husband, Matt, in the first few weeks of college, and they have been inseparable ever since. They waited to get married until the time was right, and this summer they will have their first baby.</p>

        <p class="right-text">Like most people, Nicole always wanted to buy her dream home. Two years ago, she and Matt found it in the Catskills in upstate New York. It has beautiful scenery, and all the kinds of activities that they enjoy nearby.</p>
